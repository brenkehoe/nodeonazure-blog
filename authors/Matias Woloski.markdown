I have worked on a variety of stuff over the last decade, the constant has been emergent technology and pragmatism. Most of the work I've done has been around the Microsoft ecosystem. In year 2007 I've got interested in cloud computing, when it was just a hype pushed by software as a service companies. I've finished my [engineering thesis](http://materias.fi.uba.ar/7500/woloski-tesisingenieriainformatica.pdf) in 2008 and since then I co-authored three books with the Microsoft patterns & practices team: [Developing Applications for the Cloud on Windows Azure](http://www.amazon.com/Developing-Applications-Microsoft-Platform-Practices/dp/0735656061), [Moving Applications to the Cloud on Windows Azure](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735649677/) and my latest passion: [A Guide to Claims-Based Identity and Access Control](http://www.amazon.com/Claims-Based-Identity-Control-Patterns-Practices/dp/0735640599). 
Throughout that time I've been working at Southworks, an Argentinian-based software development company. As the first employee, I've proudly helped building a team of awesome developers that can do *anything* where quality and communication are top priority.
